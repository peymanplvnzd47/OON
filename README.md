# OON
Open Optical Network

This simulator has been developed under the course Open Optical Network at Politecnico di Torino. The goal of this simulator is to replicate the behavior of an optical network with fiber and calculate the GSNR required for each connection. In this simulator, you get a JSON file representing the configuration of the network including nodes and edges. It also randomly generates connections based on a request matrix which is controllable by the user. In this work, you can select the type of transceivers at nodes from a list [fixed rate - flexible rate- Shannon]. And start generating traffic until reaching the saturation point of the network.
